I see that the deployment link provided shows an error message. From the output, it seems like the **Next.js version is not detected**, and this could be a key issue in the deployment setup.

### Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the problem and potential solutions:

1. **Missing `next` Dependency**:

   * From the logs you provided earlier, the error message says **"No Next.js version detected"**.
   * You need to have **Next.js** included in your `package.json` file. It's possible that the framework preset you chose did not correctly detect Next.js.
   * To fix this, ensure you have the correct Next.js version listed in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` in your `package.json` file.

   Here's how you can do that:

   1. Open your `package.json`.
   2. Under `dependencies`, make sure **Next.js** is included:

      ```json
      "dependencies": {
        "next": "^12.0.0", // or the latest version
        "react": "^17.0.0",
        "react-dom": "^17.0.0"
      }
      ```
   3. Run:

      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
   4. Re-deploy the app on Vercel.

2. **Check Root Directory**:

   * Vercel needs to know where your `package.json` is located. If it’s not at the root of your project directory, make sure to specify the correct **Root Directory** in your Vercel settings.
   * Ensure the `package.json` file is in the root directory of your project or configure Vercel to detect it in the right location.

3. **Vercel Build Configuration**:

   * If your project is not a **Next.js** app, but you’re using something else like **Vite** (as mentioned), you need to make sure the correct build setup is configured for the platform you're using.
   * If you are using Vite or another build system, you should select the right build environment in Vercel. For example, for Vite, choose **Node.js** as the build preset.

### Next Steps:

1. **Add Next.js to Dependencies**: If you're using Next.js, update your `package.json` to include Next.js, then deploy again.
2. **Check Vercel Settings**: Ensure Vercel is configured correctly to handle your project setup, including the root directory and any build-specific configurations.
3. **Review the Vercel Logs**: Once you deploy, check the Vercel logs again to see if the issue is resolved. If there are still errors, they should provide more context about what is causing the issue.
